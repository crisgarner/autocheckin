# autocheckin

This project uses POAP Tokens as stake in order to allow users to auto check-in on Kickback. 

### Demo: https://youthful-goodall-86dca3.netlify.com/ (Ropsten, you need Ropsten POAP tokens)

### Steps:
1. Organizer Open Event
2. Users approve the autocheckin contract to receive their POAP tokens
3. Organizers can call the ListAttendees to get the users that checked in
4. Users can retrieve their tokens 24 hours after the event opened

### Infura API Signup And Usage Prize
I used Infura API to deploy the contracts to ropsten and connect to Ethers.js and walletconect. The screenshot is empty since by mistake I used a wrong API and didn't log the transactions.
